difference_test()
=================
Conducts a few different statistical tests which test for a difference between
independent or related samples with or without equal variances and has the ability
to calculate the effect size of the observed difference. The data is
returned in a Pandas DataFrame by default, but can be returned as a dictionary
if specified.

This method is similar to researchpy.ttest(), except it allows the user to use
the formula syntax.

This method can perform the following tests:
  * Independent sample t-test :cite:`2018:scipy_ttest_ind`

      * `psudo-code: difference_test(formula_like, data, equal_variances = True, independent_samples = True)`

  * Paired sample t-test :cite:`2018:scipy_ttest_rel`

      * `psudo-code: difference_test(formula_like, data, equal_variances = True, independent_samples = False)`

  * Welch's t-test :cite:`2018:scipy_ttest_ind`

      * `psudo-code: difference_test(formula_like, data, equal_variances = False, independent_samples = True)`

  * Wilcoxon ranked-sign test :cite:`2018:scipy_wilcoxon`

      * By default, discards all zero-differences; this is known as the 'wilcox' method.
      * `psudo-code: difference_test(formula_like, data, equal_variances = False, independent_samples = False)`

2 objects will be returned for all available tests; the first object will be a
descriptive summary table and the second will be the testing result information which
will include the effect size measures if indicated.

.. note::
    This can be a one step, or two step process.

    **One step**
    .. code:: python

        difference_test("DV ~ IV", data).conduct()

    **Two step**
    .. code:: python

        model = difference_test("DV ~ IV", data)
        model.conduct()



Welch Degrees of freedom
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are two degrees of freedom options available when calculating the Welch's t-test. The default is to use
the Satterthwaite :cite:`Satterthwaite1946` calculation with the option to use the Welch :cite:`Welch1947` calculation.

Satterthwaite (1946)
""""""""""""""""""""

.. math::

  \frac{(\frac{s^2_x}{n_x} + \frac{s^2_y}{n_y})^2}{\frac{(\frac{s^2_x}{n_x})^2}{n_x-1} + \frac{(\frac{s^2_y}{n_y})^2}{n_y-1} }


Welch (1947)
""""""""""""

.. math::

  -2 + \frac{(\frac{s^2_x}{n_x} + \frac{s^2_y}{n_y})^2}{\frac{(\frac{s^2_x}{n_x})^2}{n_x+1} + \frac{(\frac{s^2_y}{n_y})^2}{n_y+1}}


Effect size measures formulas
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Cohen's d\ :sub:`s` (between subjects design)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Cohen's d\ :sub:`s` :cite:`cohen1988` for a between groups design is calculated
with the following equation:

.. math::

  d_s = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{(n_1 - 1)SD^2_1 + (n_2 - 1)SD^2_2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}}}





Cohen's d\ :sub:`av` (within subject design)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Another version of Cohen's d is used in within subject designs. This is noted
by the subscript "av". The formula for Cohen's d\ :sub:`av` :cite:`lakens2013` is
as follows:

.. math::

  d_{av} = \frac{M_{diff}}{\frac{SD_{1} + SD_{2}}{2}}





Hedges's g\ :sub:`s` (between subjects design)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Cohen's d\ :sub:`s` gives a biased estimate of the effect size for a population
and Hedges and Olkin :cite:`hedges1985` provides an unbiased estimation. The
differences between Hedges's g and Cohen's d is negligible when sample sizes
are above 20, but it is still preferable to report Hedges's g :cite:`kline2004`.
Hedge's g\ :sub:`s` is calculated using the following formula:

.. math::

  \text{Hedges's g}_s = \text{Cohen's d}_s \times (1 - \frac{3}{4(n_1 + n_2 - 9)})





Hedges's g\ :sub:`av` (within subjects design)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Cohen's d\ :sub:`av` gives a biased estimate of the effect size for a population
and Hedges and Olkin :cite:`hedges1985` provides a correction to be applied to provide an unbiased estimate.
Hedge's g\ :sub:`av` is calculated using the following formula :cite:`lakens2013` :

.. math::

  \text{Hedges's g}_{av} = \text{Cohen's d}_av \times (1 - \frac{3}{4(n_1 + n_2 - 9)})



Glass's :math:`\Delta` (between or within subjects design)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Glass's :math:`\Delta` is the mean differences between the two groups divided by
the standard deviation of the first condition/group or by the second condition/group.
When used in a within subjects design, it is recommended to use the pre- standard
deviation in the denominator :cite:`lakens2013`; the following formulas are used
to calculate Glass's :math:`\Delta`:

.. math::

  \Delta_1 = \frac{(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2)}{SD_1}

  \Delta_2 = \frac{(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2)}{SD_2}


Pearson correlation coefficient r (between or within subjects design)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Rosenthal :cite:`rosenthal1991` provided the following formula to calculate
the Pearson correlation coefficient r using the t-value and degrees of freedom:

.. math::

  r = \frac{t}{\sqrt{t^2 + df}}

Rosenthal :cite:`rosenthal1991` provided the following formula to calculate
the Pearson correlation coefficient r using the z-value and N. This formula
is used to calculate the r coefficient for the Wilcoxon ranked-sign test. Note,
that N is the total number of observations.

.. math::

  r = \frac{Z}{\sqrt{N}}


Rank-Biserial correlation coefficient r (between or within subjects design)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The following formula is used to calculate the Rank-Biserial
correlation coefficient r using the W-value and N. This formula
is used to calculate the r coefficient for the Wilcoxon ranked-sign test.

.. math::

  \text{Rank-Biserial r} = \frac{W}{\sum{\text{rank}}}





Examples
--------
First let's create an example data set to work through the examples. This will be done using
numpy (to create fake data) and pandas (to hold the data in a data frame).

.. code:: python

    import numpy, pandas, researchpy

    numpy.random.seed(12345678)

    df = pandas.DataFrame(numpy.random.randint(10, size= (100, 2)),
                      columns= ['No', 'Yes'])

    df["id"] = range(1, df.shape[0] + 1)

    df.head()

.. parsed-literal::

    No  Yes  id
    3    2   1
    4    1   2
    0    1   3
    8    2   4
    6    6   5

If one has data like this and doesn't want to reshape the data, then *researchpy.different_test()* will not work and
one should use *researchpy.ttest()* instead. However, moving forward researchpy will be going in the
direction of syntax style input and it is recommended to get comfortable using this
approach if one plans to use researchpy in the future.

Currently the data is in a wide format and it needs to be in a long format, i.e. one variable
with the dependent variable data and another with the independent variable data. The current data
structure won't work and it needs to be reshaped; there are a few ways to do this, one
will be shown below.

.. code-block:: python

    df2 = pandas.melt(df, id_vars = "id", value_vars = ["No", "Yes"],
                      var_name = "Exercise", value_name = "StressReactivity")

    df2.head()

.. parsed-literal::

    id Exercise  StressReactivity
    1       No                 3
    2       No                 4
    3       No                 0
    4       No                 8
    5       No                 6

Now the data is in the correct structure.


.. code:: python

    # Independent t-test

    # If you don't store the 2 returned DataFrames, it outputs as a tuple and
    # is displayed
    difference_test("StressReactivity ~ C(Exercise)",
